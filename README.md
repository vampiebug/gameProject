<h1>Game Project</h1>
Add your name to your recent changes and the tasks you plan to work on next (I only have my name on one right now because I don't know which I want to do after that). 
<h2>Recent Changes:</h2>
  <li>Created Tower class to represent the sets of Blocks.(Caitlyn)</li>
  <li>Added Mastermind to the factory and tested. (Caitlyn)</li>
  <li>Outputs asterisks when the guessed number is found in a neighboring block. (Caitlyn)</li>
  <li>Created the new Block class. (Caitlyn)</li> 
  <li>Replaced Pu and Cpu structs with Blocks and updated their traversal. (Caitlyn)</li>
<h2>To Do:</h2>
  <li>Implement getInput() and make sure that the user's guesses are clean</li>
  <li>Fix the highscore implementation (Caitlyn)</li>
  <li>Finish all other parts of Game implementation</li>
  <li>fix formatting on the mastermind game</li>
  <li>Clean up comments</li>
  <li>fix play again</li>
<h2>More Ideas:</h2>
  <li>Make the game scalable to different size lists</li>
  <li>To make the game more like traditional mastermind, check if the guessed number appears in the list. May be difficult to do with a linked list?</li>
